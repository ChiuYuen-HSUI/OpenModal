# OpenModal
OpenModal is an open source experimental modal analysis software written in Python.

OpenModal combines geometry builder, measurement, identification and animation module to aid in experimental analysis of the dynamic properties of structures. It is written in Python and published under the GPL license.

## Running the software
In order to develop the software on the same Python version with the corresponding library versions, it is recommended
to create a virtual environment with the `pipenv` library.

In order to set the environment use the command prompt (terminal, Windows PowerShell,...) and execute the following:

```
pip install pipenv
cd .\path\to\OpenModal
pipenv install requests
```

This should should install the `pipenv` library and install the virtual environment.

To run the software, execute the following:

```
cd openModal/
python openmodal.py
```
